WH40K README
This is a README file for the Wh40k Application project. The project consists of backend server code written in Node.js using Express.js for handling HTTP requests, MongoDB for data storage, and Socket.IO for real-time communication. Below is an overview of the project structure and instructions on how to set it up.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

controllers: Contains controller functions for handling user and message-related operations.
model: Contains Mongoose schema definitions for the User and Message models.
routes: Contains route definitions for user and message endpoints.
utils: Contains utility functions and API route constants.
app.js: Main entry point of the backend application, where the Express server is initialized and routes are configured.
server.js: Sets up the Express server, connects to MongoDB, and initializes the Socket.IO server for real-time communication.
.env: Configuration file for environment variables such as MongoDB connection URI and server port.
package.json: Contains project dependencies and scripts.
Installation
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd chat-application
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project root and add the following variables:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=<server-port>
MONGO_URL=<mongodb-connection-uri>
Start the server:

sql
Copy code
npm start
Usage
Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman or curl to make HTTP requests to the defined endpoints for user authentication, message handling, and real-time chat functionality.
